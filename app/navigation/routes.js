/**
 * This file defines a frozen object containing route name constants used throughout the app for navigation.
 * 
 * Each key maps to a screen identifier, ensuring consistent and typo-free references across navigators and components.
 * It includes routes for:
 * - Core app flows (`APPNAVIGATOR`, `SCAN_ITEM`, `FOOD_ITEM`)
 * - User account management (`ACCOUNT`, `ACCOUNT_EDIT`, `DELETE`, `RESET_PASSWORD`)
 * - Child Mode features (`CHILD_HOME`, `CHILD_SCAN`, `CHILD_BADGES`, etc.)
 * - Educational content (`DYES`, `SUGARS`, `VITAMINS`, `FATS`, `ENERGY`)
 * - Utility and support (`SETTINGS`, `HELP`, `ABOUT`)
 * 
 * Using `Object.freeze` ensures the route map remains immutable and safe from accidental modification.
 * 
 * Generated by CoPilot AI
