/**
 * This code sets up a stack navigator for advertisement-related screens using React Navigation in a React Native app.
 * 
 * It includes a single screen, `SponsoredBy`, which is rendered without a header for a cleaner, distraction-free layout.
 * This navigator can be expanded to include additional promotional or sponsor-related views in the future.
