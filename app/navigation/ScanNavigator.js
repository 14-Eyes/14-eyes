/**
 * This code sets up a stack navigator for the scanning feature of the app using React Navigation.
 * 
 * It includes:
 * - `ScanningScreen`: where users can scan food items via barcode or image
 * - `FoodDetails`: displays nutritional and ingredient information about the scanned item
 * 
 * The navigator uses `mode="modal"` to present screens in a modal style, enhancing focus and user flow during scanning and review.
