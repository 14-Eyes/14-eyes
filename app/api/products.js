/**
 * This code defines a function for retrieving product data from the OpenFoodFacts API using a barcode identifier.
 * 
 * It constructs a URL endpoint based on the barcode value and sends a GET request through the preconfigured API client.
 * The response typically includes nutritional information, ingredients, and other metadata about the scanned item.
